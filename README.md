# Web-Scraping
Developed a web scraping automation script using JavaScript and Puppeteer to extract individual political contribution data from the FEC website.
Extracted contributor data from an Excel sheet and generated URLs for each contributor using JavaScript.
Utilized Puppeteer to automate navigation and data extraction from multiple web pages.
Extracted key fields including contributor name, occupation, employer, contribution amount, report year, election type, committee, political party and state into an Excel sheet.
Implemented pagination handling to ensure comprehensive data retrieval across multiple web pages.
Demonstrated strong debugging skills through real-time monitoring and problem resolution.
The final result was a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet containing detailed information about individual contributors and their political contributions. 
This project enhanced my technical skills in web scraping, data manipulation, and automation, showcasing my ability to develop effective solutions for complex data retrieval challenges.
